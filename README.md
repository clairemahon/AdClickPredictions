# Optimizing Internet Ad-Click Predictions: An Evaluation of Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and KNN Models

A group project for AI Machine Learning Foundations Class at IE University, Madrid.

We formed an analysis using Machine Learning Techniques on an Ad Click Dataset to determine what influences online shoppers to click on an advertisement. The dataset was provided by Professor Lee.

"Machine learning models have proven to be a game-changer for pinpointing what drives people to click on ads online. These tools cut through the complexity of consumer data, revealing the specific factors that attract clicks. With this knowledge, advertisers can tailor their campaigns to match what people are interested in, making ads more effective. In short, machine learning turns the vast sea of advertising data into actionable insights, leading to smarter and more successful ads."
